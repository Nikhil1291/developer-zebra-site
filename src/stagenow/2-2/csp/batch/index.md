## About Batch

### Overview

The Batch setting type is used to execute one Profile (which may contain any number of settings) from within another Profile.  This can be viewed as sort of a subroutine call.  In StageNow, a Batch setting is used internally (without explicit reference by the staging administrator) to generate bar codes and NFC tags and to implement execution of the Deployment Section read from a Deployment Server.
