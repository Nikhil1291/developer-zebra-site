## About Clock

### Overview

The Clock setting type sets the date and time. To account for time zone nuances including daylight saving time, Clock expects the date and time to be entered as normalized values to UTC (GMT) time. In other words, the date and time set as parameters for Clock must be the UTC (GMT) equivalent of the local time being set.
