## About Access

### Overview

The Access Manager setting type configures a set of applications that are allowed to run and install on the device. When this setting is enabled, the device only allows user installed applications on the Whitelist to be executed and/or installed (some applications that are part of the default operating system are still available). To disable the Whitelist, select 'Single User Without Whitelist'.
