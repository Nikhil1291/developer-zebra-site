This parm allows you to change the state of the Bluetooth radio by Turning it On or Off. Turning the Bluetooth radio On would allow the device to connect to other to other Bluetooth devices that have previously been paired or would allow the setup of a new pairing.

>**Note:** This parm is only available from KitKat onwards. It is not supported on JellyBean devices.
